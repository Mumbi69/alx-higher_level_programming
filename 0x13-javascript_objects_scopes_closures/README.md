# JavaScript Object Basics:
* JavaScript is an object-oriented language, and objects are one of its fundamental data types.
* Objects are collections of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or symbols in modern JavaScript) and values can be any data type, including other objects.

# Object-Oriented JavaScript:
* JavaScript supports OOP by allowing you to create and work with objects, define classes (in ES6 and later), and implement concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism using prototypes and constructors.

# Class - ES6:
* ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced the class keyword to JavaScript, allowing you to define classes in a more structured and syntactically clear way.
* Classes are blueprints for creating objects with shared properties and methods. They provide a convenient way to implement OOP principles in JavaScript.


# super - ES6:
* In ES6 classes, the super keyword is used to call methods from a parent class within a subclass.
* It allows you to access and invoke the constructor and methods of the parent class, enabling inheritance and method overriding.


# extends - ES6:
* The extends keyword in ES6 is used to create a subclass (a child class) that inherits properties and methods from a parent class.
* It establishes an "is-a" relationship between the parent and child classes, facilitating code reuse and specialization.


# Object Prototypes:
* A prototype is an object from which other objects inherit properties and methods.
* Prototypal inheritance is a fundamental concept in JavaScript, and you can use it to create relationships between objects and implement inheritance.


# Inheritance in JavaScript:
* Inheritance in JavaScript allows you to create a hierarchy of objects where child objects (subclasses) can inherit properties and methods from parent objects (superclasses).
* This is often achieved using prototypes, the extends keyword in ES6, and the concept of "prototype chains."


# Closures:
* Closures are a concept in JavaScript that allows functions to "remember" the scope in which they were created, even after that scope has exited.
* Closures are essential for data encapsulation and maintaining private variables in JavaScript.
